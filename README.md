This project implements the **Zero-DCE (Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation)** model for enhancing images captured in **low-light conditions**, using deep learning. The model learns image-specific enhancement curves without the need for paired training data.

## üîç Problem Statement

Low-light images suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and noise ‚Äî making it difficult for human viewing and downstream computer vision tasks. The goal of this project is to apply a deep learning model (Zero-DCE) to enhance such images **without any reference image**.

## üß† What is Zero-DCE?

**Zero-DCE (CVPR 2020)** is a lightweight deep curve estimation model that:
- Does **not require paired datasets** (i.e., no need for original and enhanced image pairs)
- Learns **image enhancement curves** using a CNN
- Optimizes for exposure, contrast, color consistency, and spatial smoothness
